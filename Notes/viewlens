View lens is a pair of functions:
get: model -> viewmodel
update: model -> (viewmodel -> viewmodel) -> model

1. Server usage:
- get model 
- use update to do something over it
- save model

2. Client usage:
GET:
- get model (all params should be in URL)
- use get to retrieve viewmodel
- send to client

POST:
- get initial and updated models from client
- get model with the same params from URL (we need default model for create operation)
- optional conflicts detection: map model to viewmodel with get, compare with initial model from client
- use update to map viewmodel to loaded model. Validation should go here
- save changes


ideas
- master-detail relations should be hashes, so any child should have an id
